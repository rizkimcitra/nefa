# <p align="center"> [WIP] NeFa </p>

NeFa is a web application that provides buying and selling of cryptocurrencies

designed with love from [@irvanmoses](https://github.com/irvanmoses).

Run this app without editing, just open `index.html` file

If you want to edit the UI, make sure to run this command:

```bash
yarn install
```

and then

```bash
yarn dev
```

so tailwindcss will generate utility classes you need
